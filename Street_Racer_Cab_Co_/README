To run 'Street_Racer_Cab_Co_' make sure to download all the files, put them into a folder with the name of the main file (Street_Racer...)
and make sure to include 'DPAero' in the folder as well otherwise it will crash.
Note: This is an old-ish game from me so it's not perfect, do the 'How to Play' first when you launch it to learn the basics
I should probably include this in the game if I haven't but Score is based on time 1 point per second
