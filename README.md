# Personal
My personal repository where I will be uploading, creating and editing personal projects that may be completed or in progress.

For most if not all of these projects I will be using various coding languages some of which require their
proper IDE to run (Don't worry they're probably Open Source i.e. free) I will post links to any IDEs required, below:
